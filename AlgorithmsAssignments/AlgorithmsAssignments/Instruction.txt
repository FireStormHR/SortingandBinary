RULES:

1. You are not allowed to use any kind of help, for example, course materials, Internet, code made at home
2. At the end of the oral, compress your work in a .zip archive (not .rar, .7zip, .targz!!!) and upload it on natschool.
3. If you are caught using help you will be disqualified and reported to the exam commission for plagiarism.

ASSIGNMENT:
1. Complete the parts of the code where you find the comments saying that you have to complete (CTRL + F and search for "COMPLETE").  DO NOT REMOVE THE COMMENT.
2. To test your work unload the projects you are not working on (right click -> unload) to be able to compile only the parts you completed.
3. In Program.cs you already have a graph that you can use to test Dijkstra or Floyd-Warshall.
4. Choose to complete either Dijkstra or Floyd-Warshall, not both. It is wise to choose the one you used in the home assignments :).
